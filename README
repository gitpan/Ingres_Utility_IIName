Ingres-Utility-IIMonitor version 0.0.1
Ingres-Utility-IIMonitor

This module provides an easy interface to the iimonitor utility of
the Ingres RDBMS, which provides a mean to locally control
IIDBMS servers and sessions (conections).

To use this module, the current user should be the Ingres
installation owner, usually "ingres", to have rights to use all
functions.

Environment variables (II_SYSTEM et ali) should bet set also.

Through this interface, it is possible to obtain a list of all
registered services, for later processing (eg. iimonitor).
